# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented a button interface and phase control techniques which are implemented with PIC16F1509 Microcontroller and 74HC595 shift registers to optimize the number of pins.\
I have also uploaded a code flow in a PDF file named Code_Flowchart.pdf which contains the state machine flow for the program. \
Here are my demo videos on YouTube: https://youtu.be/SaVg_QAmbHg
