# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented a 7-Segment LEDs Counter (from 00 to 99) and a 7-Segment Clock with 4 digits. They are both implemented with PIC16F1509 Microcontroller and 74HC595 shift registers to minimize the number of pins in used.\
Here are my demo videos on YouTube:\
