# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented two exercises in which the first exercise is a simple one with an LED array controlled by PIC16F887 with more pins. And in the second exercise, I presented a settable countdown timer using loop structure with 4 digits display with PIC16F1509 Microcontroller. Moreover, in these exercises, I used optimized way to display digits combined with calculations, no more long switch and cases. \
Additional Info.: At the time of doing this project, I hadn't known about interrupt.\
