# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented a 7-Segment LEDs Counter (from 00 to 99) and a 7-Segment Clock with 4 digits. They are both implemented with PIC16F1509 Microcontroller and 74HC595 shift registers to optimize the number of pins in used rather than its previous Week 02 counterpart.\
Here are my demo videos on YouTube:\
For the first exercise:  https://youtu.be/wuGHlsFI_QY \
For the second exercise: https://youtu.be/71JukpOGoq0
Note: Clock in this exercise are speeded up to demonstrate the working of system, rather than being  true clock
