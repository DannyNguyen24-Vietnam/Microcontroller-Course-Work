# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented two exercises using the UART Communication: In the 1st exercise, an LEDs array display is controlled by command sent via UART and processed by the main controller of PIC16F1509. In the 2nd exercise, a small game named 'Guess your age' is presented, this game is played through UART communication. \
