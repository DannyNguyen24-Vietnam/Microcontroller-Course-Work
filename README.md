# Microcontroller-Course-Work
The topics of this week (the end week) are about DC motor control using driver and combining with what I have learned previously, and I presented here two exercises with two similar tasks: The 1st task (1st exercise) is to control a DC motor with 4 level of speed (4 level of PWM) and display the level on the 7-segment display, and the 2nd task (2nd exercise) is to control the motor speed with the potentiometer and display the PWM value on the LCD display.\
Here are my video links:\
