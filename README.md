# Microcontroller-Course-Work
In this project, I presented a 7-Segment LEDs Counter (from 00 to 99) and a 7-Segment Clock with 4 digits. They are implemented with PIC16F1509 (for the counter) and PIC16F886 (for the Clock) Microcontrollers without using any 74HC595 shift registers.\
Here are my demo videos on YouTube:\
