# Microcontroller-Course-Work
Greetings! Welcome to my new repository (but with old work) which contains all of my work on both microcontroller theory and practical courses at the time when I was still a sophomore. In this repository, most topics are about the Microchip PIC Microcontroller.\
Projects are organized in branches, so don't be panic if you don't see any thing here except a YouTube video link, just click the 'branches' to see.\
Here is a small demo video of my final project for the theory course:\

The robot controlled by PIC16F1827 microcontroller with 4 infared sensor to detect the line. The DC motors are controlled by L298n H-brigde.
